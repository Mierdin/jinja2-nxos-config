# NXOS Jinja2 Template Configuration File
#
# Author: Matt Oswalt (http://keepingitclassless.net)
#
# This configuration file houses all of the dymanically populated information
# that makes it's way into an NXOS configuration script through Jinja2
# templates.
#
# Refer to the README for more details on how to use this tool.

# CORESNIPPETS
#
# These are the core snippets needed to build a basic, 
# switch-agnostic configuration.

# FEATURES

# Enables features on the switch
# Currently using actual NXOS feature syntax, this may change in future
features:
    - feature fcoe
    - install feature-set fabricpath
    - feature-set fabricpath
    - feature npiv
    - feature fport-channel-trunk
    - feature tacacs+
    - cfs eth distribute
    - feature udld
    - feature interface-vlan

# QOS
#
# Specifies some parameters to be used in a standard MQC-style configuration
qos:
    defaultmtu: 1500 # The MTU to be used on class-default 
                     # (unclassified) traffic

# PORTS
#
# Specifies general configuration settings for individual ports. Many ports 
# receive more specific configuration as part of the "feature installation"
# option in future versions, but this is a handy way to make en masse changes
# first.
ports:
    trunks:

        #TODO: need to make this not a simple string - probably a list

# MISC
#
# This section contains various portions of the configuration that don't 
# deserve their own section. Because they're stupid, that's why.
